## 2026-03-19 - Render-Blocking @import in Global CSS
**Learning:** Using `@import` inside a main CSS file to load Google Fonts creates a sequential bottleneck. Even if fonts are preloaded in the HTML `<head>`, the CSS parser will halt and wait for the `@import` resolution, negating the async loading benefits and artificially delaying First Contentful Paint (FCP).
**Action:** Never use `@import` for external fonts in global stylesheets if the fonts are already properly preloaded and linked in the HTML document head.
